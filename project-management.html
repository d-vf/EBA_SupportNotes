<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Economic and financial dimensions</h3>
<p>Projects evaluation can be described as a methodology for assessing the economic and financial (and social and environmental) impact of a proposed investment.</p>
<p>Project evaluation should focus on two dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An <strong>Economic analysis</strong>, which is a systematic approach to determine the optimum use of resources (capital, human resources) and it involves the comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective under certain assumptions and constraints. In particular, it attempts to measure in monetary terms the costs and benefits of the project to the organization or the community or economy.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Financial analysis</strong>, which aims to determine the financial resources to develop the project, like choosing the funding sources (equity or debt).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When we refer to the economic analysis of a project, we are most of the times referring to the idea of the Opportunity Cost of a given decision.</p>
</div>
<div id="opportunity-cost" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Opportunity cost</h3>
<p>The opportunity cost is the benefit or value that you give up by choosing one option over another. In other words, the opportunity cost of a decision is the difference between the value you receive from pursuing a certain option and the value that you would have received from the alternative that you chose not to pursue.</p>
<p>We can express opportunity cost in terms of a return (or profit) on investment by using the following mathematical formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Opportunity Cost = Return on Most Profitable Investment Choice - Return on Investment Chosen to Pursue\]</span></p>
<p>Unless the investment returns are fixed and guaranteed to be paid (like a Treasury bond you intend to hold to maturity), youâll have to base your calculation on the expected returns.</p>
<p>Example: imagine you want to buy an efficient equipment.</p>
<p>You have two potential options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change lighting system to LED (20% return on investment)or</li>
<li>installing a PV system (10% return on investment).</li>
</ul>
<p>The opportunity cost is the difference between the benefits you would get from the one option (e.g.Â Change lighting system to LED) over another (installing a PV system).</p>
<p>What is the opportunity cost?</p>
<p>If you decide to leave install a new PV system, the opportunity cost is:</p>
<p>20% (changing the lighting system) - 10% (installing the pv system, option that is being pursuit) = 10%</p>
<p>This is your trade off for choosing one option instead of another.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-value-of-money" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Time value of money</h3>
<p>When dealing with financial investments one of the basic underlying issues emerges from answering the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you prefer to have 100â¬ today or invest 100â¬ for a future income?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of time is quite fundamental in finance, because in general, the money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future, due to its potential earning capacity.</p>
<p>Time value of money can reflect that a certain amount of money today has a different buying power (value) than the same currency amount of money in the future, but is not an equivalent.</p>
<p>If you consider as geometric series, the first term would be the present value, the common ratio would be (1+i) and n, number of periods.</p>
<p>So we start by this basic formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Future\ Value = Present Value \cdot (1+i)^n\]</span></p>
<p>Or the present Value of a certain amount of money C (at n year) is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Present\ Value = \frac{C}{(1+i)^n}\]</span></p>
<p>Cash Flow C - Net amount of money that goes in or out of a project</p>
<p>If we want to estimate how much is the Present value of a certain future cash flows C that will be collected in the future ânâ year,<br />
where n is the number of compounding periods between the present date and the date where the sum is worth C i is the interest rate for one compounding period (the end of a compounding period is when interest is applied, for example, annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily).</p>
<p>(The interest rate i is given as a percentage, but expressed as a decimal in this formula. If using periods with less than one year, for example 6 month would be power of Â½ or 6/12)</p>
<p>Compounding is the process where the value of an investment increases because the earnings on an investment, both capital gains and interest, earn interest as time passes. This exponential growth occurs because the total growth of an investment along with its principal earn money in the next period. This differs from linear growth, where only the principal earns interest each period.</p>
<p>If you consider as geometric series, the first term would be the present value, the common ratio would be (1+i) and n, number of periods</p>
<p>Figure 1 - Geometric growth</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image1.jpg" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>If you notice, more than the interest rate, times plays a central role, or what so called the power compound interest, so you are dealing with geometric growth, not linear and the reasoning can be linked to the idea of trade-offs. You will defer consumption today, to have a certain return in n years, but because you just will have that return in n years it is like if you were reinvesting every year.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>year 0, you have 100â¬, year 1, you would have 100+1.10 (10% rate), year 2, you start with 110 (and not 100 â¬) so you will have 121 (110*1.1) and so on.</p>
<p>Another way to put is:</p>
<p>What is would you choose? 1) 100â¬ today or; 2) 103â¬ in 1 year</p>
<p>If you consider a 4% interest rate</p>
<p>We would level both options with the previous formula</p>
<p>So option 1 would be equivalent to: <span class="math inline">\(100 \times (1.04)^1\)</span> or 104â¬</p>
<p>or doing for present value <span class="math inline">\(C_0 =103/104 = 99â¬\)</span></p>
<p>So 100â¬ are equal to 104â¬ in 1 year and 103â¬ in 1 year time is equivalent to 99â¬ today.</p>
<p>The time value of money is the assumption that money can generate value if it is invested (for example interests in a bank), so it is better to receive the money now than later.</p>
<p>At the end, the same amount of money today has a different and higher buying power (value) than the same amount of money in the future, it is not an equivalent.</p>
<p>The rate at which the money is appreciate or depreciate is called the discount rate. This discount rate may represent different factors but is often considered to be the interest rate given by the treasury bounds of central banks at 10 years, usually are used as benchmark (risk free) to computed riskier investments. It is often represented by the letter âiâ of interest.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>1010=1000x(1+0.01), with n=1</p>
<p>Imagine that you have 1000â¬ and you put in the bank with a 1% interest rate. In one year, the 1000 euros you have today will be worth 1010â¬.</p>
<p>In 2 years it will be worth 1020.1â¬.</p>
<p>Cash Flow C - Net amount of money that goes in or out of a project If we want to estimate how much is the Present value of a certain future cash flows C that will be collected in the future ânâ year, we can invert the future value formula and obtain the present value formula:</p>
<p>Time of value example</p>
<p>990.01=1000/(1+0.01), with n=1 Imagine that you have the opportunity to collect 1000â¬ in one year.</p>
<p>That is equivalent to receiving today only 990.01 â¬ (because if you put in the bank today 990.01 â¬), you will have 1000 euros next year.</p>
</div>
<div id="money" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> Money</h3>
<p>Money can also be defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Itâs a store of value, meaning that money allows you to defer consumption until a later date.</li>
<li>Itâs a unit of account, meaning that it allows you to assign a value to different goods without having to compare them. So instead of saying that a car is worth ten cows, you can just say it (or the cows) cost 10 000 â¬.</li>
<li>And itâs a medium of exchangeâan easy and efficient way for you and me and others to trade goods and services with one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea that a euro today is worth more than a euro tomorrow, relates more to the second and last roles, storage and medium of exchange, because the value of money at a future point of time would take account of interest earned and the inflation accrued over a given period of time.</p>
<p>Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation, and avoid deflation, in order to keep the economy running smoothly, namely by setting interest rates.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="indicators" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Indicators</h2>
<p>Basic indicators that should be computed to evaluate a project and aid in the decision of developing it or not: net present value, internal rate of return and payback period.</p>
<div id="net-present-value-npv" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Net Present Value (NPV)</h3>
<p>The first indicator to evaluate a project, is the Net Present Value (NPV), which basically estimates the value that will be gained at present costs by developing the project. This estimate consists in adding all future net earnings (the cashflows) minus the initial investment that is required to execute the project.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[NPV_{i, N}  \sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} - Investment\]</span></p>
<p>Net present value (NPV) of a project is the potential change in an investorâs wealth caused by that project while time value of money is being accounted for. It equals the present value of net cash inflows generated by a project less the initial investment on the project. It is one of the most reliable measures used in capital budgeting because it accounts for time value of money by using discounted cash flows in the calculation.</p>
<p>Net present value calculations take the following two inputs: Projected net cash flows in successive periods from the project. A target rate of return i.e.Â the discount rate.</p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p>Net cash flow equals total cash inflow during a period, including salvage value if any, less cash outflows from the project during the period.</p>
<p>Hurdle rate is the rate used to discount the net cash inflows. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)is the most commonly used discount rate.</p>

</div>
<p>NPV (even and uneven)</p>
<p>Calculation Methods and Formulas</p>
<p>The first step involved in the calculation of NPV is the estimation of net cash flows from the project over its life. The second step is to discount those cash flows at the hurdle rate.</p>
<p>NPV (even and uneven)</p>
<p>The net cash flows may be even (i.e.Â equal cash flows in different periods) or uneven (i.e.Â different cash flows in different periods).</p>
<p>When they are even, present value can be easily calculated by using the formula for present value of annuity. However, if they are uneven, we need to calculate the present value of each individual net cash inflow separately. Once we have the total present value of all project cash flows, we subtract the initial investment on the project from the total present value of inflows to arrive at net present value.</p>
<p>Thus we have the following two formulas for the calculation of NPV:</p>
<p>When cash inflows are even: NPV = R Ã 1 â (1 + i)-n â Initial Investment</p>
<p>In the above formula, R is the net cash inflow expected to be received in each period; i is the required rate of return per period; n are the number of periods during which the project is expected to operate and generate cash inflows.</p>
<p>When cash inflows are uneven: NPV =</p>
<p>R1 + R2 + R3 + â¦</p>
<p>â Initial Investment</p>
<p>(1 + i)1</p>
<p>(1 + i)2</p>
<p>(1 + i)3</p>
<p>Where, i is the target rate of return per period; R1 is the net cash inflow during the first period; R2 is the net cash inflow during the second period; R3 is the net cash inflow during the third period, and so on â¦</p>
<p>Decision Rule In case of standalone projects, accept a project only if its NPV is positive, reject it if its NPV is negative and stay indifferent between accepting or rejecting if NPV is zero. In case of mutually exclusive projects (i.e.Â competing projects), accept the project with higher NPV.</p>
<p>Examples Example 1: Even Cash Inflows: Calculate the net present value of a project which requires an initial investment of $243,000 and it is expected to generate a cash inflow of $50,000 each month for 12 months. Assume that the salvage value of the project is zero. The target rate of return is 12% per annum. Solution We have, Initial Investment = $243,000 Net Cash Inflow per Period = $50,000 Number of Periods = 12 Discount Rate per Period = 12% Ã· 12 = 1% Net Present Value = $50,000 Ã (1 â (1 + 1%)^-12) Ã· 1% â $243,000 = $50,000 Ã (1 â 1.01^-12) Ã· 0.01 â $243,000 â $50,000 Ã (1 â 0.887449) Ã· 0.01 â $243,000 â $50,000 Ã 0.112551 Ã· 0.01 â $243,000 â $50,000 Ã 11.2551 â $243,000 â $562,754 â $243,000 â $319,754</p>
<p>Example 2: Uneven Cash Inflows: An initial investment of $8,320 thousand on plant and machinery is expected to generate cash inflows of $3,411 thousand, $4,070 thousand, $5,824 thousand and $2,065 thousand at the end of first, second, third and fourth year respectively. At the end of the fourth year, the machinery will be sold for $900 thousand. Calculate the net present value of the investment if the discount rate is 18%. Round your answer to nearest thousand dollars. Solution PV Factors: Year 1 = 1 Ã· (1 + 18%)^1 â 0.8475 Year 2 = 1 Ã· (1 + 18%)^2 â 0.7182 Year 3 = 1 Ã· (1 + 18%)^3 â 0.6086 Year 4 = 1 Ã· (1 + 18%)^4 â 0.5158 The rest of the calculation is summarized below: Year 1 2 3 4 Net Cash Inflow $3,411 $4,070 $5,824 $2,065 Salvage Value</p>

<p>â Initial Investment â 8,320</p>
<p>Net Present Value $2,568 thousand</p>
<p>Strengths and Weaknesses of NPV</p>
<p>Strengths Net present value accounts for time value of money which makes it a sounder approach than other investment appraisal techniques which do not discount future cash flows such payback period and accounting rate of return. Net present value is even better than some other discounted cash flows techniques such as IRR. In situations where IRR and NPV give conflicting decisions, NPV decision should be preferred.</p>
<p>Weaknesses NPV is after all an estimation. It is sensitive to changes in estimates for future cash flows, salvage value and the cost of capital. Net present value does not take into account the size of the project. For example, say Project A requires initial investment of $4 million to generate NPV of $1 million while a competing Project B requires $2 million investment to generate an NPV of $0.8 million. If we base our decision on NPV alone, we will prefer Project A because it has higher NPV, but Project B has generated more shareholdersâ wealth per dollar of initial investment ($0.8 million/$2 million vs $1 million/$4 million).</p>

<div id="internal-rate-of-return-irr" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</h3>
<p>The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), corresponds to finding out what is the rate of return of the project that makes the NPV equal to 0.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[IRR=  \sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Imagine you want to develop this project, but one of two things may happen:</p>

<li>you need to go to a bank, ask for a loan and will have to pay an interest rate of 5%;</li>
<li>you need to take the money from the bank and will loose a 5% interest rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the IRR is higher than this (5%), it means you should develop the project, as the value that you will get from the project is higher that what you need to invest.</p>

<div id="payback-period" class="section level3">

<p>Lastly, sometimes you want to know how much is the period of time required for the return on an investment to ârepayâ the sum of the original investment.</p>
<p>So the simple formula to answer that question is given as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Payback \, Period = \frac{Amount\,Invested}{Estimated\,Net\,Cash\,Flow}\]</span></p>
<p>The payback can be calculated in a simplified way â where the time value of money is not taken into account - or in a discounted way, where the net cash flows are calculated using the present cost (discounted payback period).</p>

<div id="nature" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Nature</h3>
<p>As we mention, the cashflow is the net balance between positive and negative money flows in the project. When we are dealing with project evaluation we can split the money flows between costs and revenues, by nature in the following categories:</p>
<p>Investment, Operating Financing</p>
<p>The investment costs are related to how much is it necessary to spend to generate future revenues. In the energy field, this is the investment necessary to increase energy savings (e.g.Â changing the lighting system or install a new monitoring system) or eventually to get some revenue (e.g.Â Installing a PV system that can back sell to the grid the excess)</p>
<p>The cash flow is the net balance of all the revenues and costs, regardless of their nature (financing, operating or investment)</p>
<p>In a project evaluation it should be always positive, as it means that the revenues are larger than the expenses.</p>
</div>
<div id="fix-costs-and-variable-costs" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Fix costs and variable costs</h3>
<p>You also can spilt by:</p>
<p>Fix costs and variable costs.</p>
<p>A variable cost and fixed cost are the two main costs a company has when producing goods and services. A companyâs total cost is composed of its total fixed costs and its total variable costs. Variable costs vary with the amount produced. Fixed costs remain the same, no matter how much output a company produces.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/imagem3.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>A variable cost is a companyâs cost that is associated with the amount of goods or services it produces. A companyâs variable cost increases and decreases with the production volume. For example, suppose company ABC produces ceramic mugs for a cost of $2 a mug. If the company produces 500 units, its variable cost will be $1,000. However, if the company does not produce any units, it will not have any variable cost for producing the mugs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a fixed cost does not vary with the volume of production.</p>
<p>A fixed cost does not change with the amount of goods or services a company produces. It remains the same even if no goods or services are produced. Using the same example above, suppose company ABC has a fixed cost of 10,000 per month for the machine it uses to produce mugs. If the company does not produce any mugs for the month, it would still have to pay 10,000 for the cost of renting the machine. On the other hand, if it produces 1 million mugs, its fixed cost remains the same. The variable costs change from zero to $2 million in this example.</p>
<p>value of money that has been used up to produce something, and hence is not available for use anymore Investment costs â value used to buy an asset required to the project Operation costs â value used to operate the asset required to the project Fixed costs â value of money spent because there is a project going on</p>

<div id="break-even-analysis" class="section level3">

<p>We can relate Total Costs and its Fix and Variable Costs to answer a simple question:</p>
<p>How many units do I have to sale to pay for the Fix Costs? Or to Break even?</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p><span class="math display">\[Fixed \ Costs Ã· (Price - Variable Costs) = Breakeven\ Point\ in \ Units\]</span></p>
<p>Where you divide the Fix Costs by the difference between Price and Variable Costs, that can also the the Cost of goods Sold,</p>
<p>The result is the Breakeven Point in Units, meaning how many units you have to sell to pay for the fix Costs.</p>

<div id="cash-flows-in-ee" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> Cash Flows in EE</h3>
<p>In energy efficiency, the cash flows have a special nature as they in general they do not represent a real money inflow to the company, but rather a smaller expense or outflow. When we implement an energy efficiency measure, we do not receive money for it (except in few cases, like selling electricity to the grid), but we spend less money in energy.</p>
<p>Most will assume that savings, namely in EE projects are equal to future earnings (or a future stream of cash flows), but you should be aware that is not, namely:</p>
<p>Savings means fewer costs, not more revenues;</p>
<p>Means that unless you take those savings and invest in a similar project with a similar stream of cash flows, you canÂ´t compound negative value (or for simplicity, assume that you can only compound values greater than 0).</p>
<p>You will have to make payments in the future, namely if under a EPC Contract, so when looking to an EE investment you better consider as an investment, where you may have to pay something upfront the rest delayed in future payment and in the future (after payment the investment) you will have to use fewer funds for energy.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image6.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>So you can consider as net flows of inflows and outflows of money, where EE measure will impact the outflows, still, if the outflows are 0 (you donât spend any in energy, means that you will have 0 savings because thereâs no efficiency to apply to outflows.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.5</span> Financial Statements</h3>
<p>The Relationship Between the Financial Statements</p>
<p>The income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement are all interrelated.</p>
<p>The income statement describes how the assets and liabilities were used in the stated accounting period.</p>
<p>The cash flow statement explains cash inflows and outflows, and it will ultimately reveal the amount of cash the company has on hand, which is also reported in the balance sheet. By themselves, each financial statement only provides a portion of the story of a companyâs financial condition; together, they provide a more complete picture.</p>
<p>In the context of corporate financial reporting, the income statement summarizes a companyâs revenues (sales) and expenses, quarterly and annually for its fiscal year. The final net figure, as well as various other numbers in the statement, are of major interest to the investment community.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.6</span> Investments</h3>
<p>A capital expenditure, or CAPEX, is considered an investment into the business. The money spent is not immediately reported on the income statement; rather, it is treated as an asset on the balance sheet. A CAPEX is deducted over the course of several years as a depreciation expense, beginning with the year following the purchase. The depreciation expense is reported on the income statement in the tax years it is deducted, resulting in reduced profit.</p>
<p>For example, say you own a flower shop and in 2012, you purchase a delivery van for $30,000. The van is recorded as an asset on 2012âs balance sheet, leaving the income statement for 2012 unaffected by the purchase. You expect to use the van for six years, so it is depreciated by $5,000 each year. So, on 2013âs income statement, a $5,000 expense is then reported. While a CAPEX does not directly affect income statements in the year of purchase, for each subsequent year for the expected useful life of the asset the depreciation expense affects the income statement. A CAPEX may indirectly have an immediate effect on income statements depending on the type of asset that is acquired. Using the previous example, the van purchased for the flower shop is not recorded on the income statement for 2012, but gas and insurance expenses for the van are considered business expenses that affect the income statement. However, the expenses incurred by the van may be offset by the increase in revenue produced by the delivery van.</p>
<p>The term cash and cash equivalents includes: currency, coins, checks received but not yet deposited, checking accounts, petty cash, savings accounts, money market accounts, and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase such as U.S. treasury bills and â¦</p>
<p>A cash position represents the amount of cash that a company, investment fund or bank has on its books at a specific point in time. The cash position is a sign of financial strength and liquidity.

<p>The way you decide to finance the project (Capital Structure) plays a central role in Financial Analysis.</p>
<p>EV</p>
<p>BOX</p>
<p>You can use an opportunity cost analysis to help you decide how to best capitalize a project. A projectâ capital structure is simply how a company finances its operations. Capital structure may involve a mix of debt (long-term or short-term) and equity, and Equity, which is the infusion of capital into a business using the companyâs resources, such as savings or through the sale of shares.</p>
<p>If you finance your investment through DEBT, you have to pay it back even if you arenât making any money. Moreover, money allocated to servicing debt canât be spent on investing in the business or pursuing other investment opportunities. However, debt is considered to be a cost to a company, so can be deducted.</p>
<p>Using equity means that the financing costs may be lower, but it may compromise liquidity in this or other projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, remember that depending on the Energy Efficiency projects and the regulation of the country, some investments may have a positive fiscal Impact (e.g.Â tax abatement) or may give access to special credit. So at the end, the project evaluation should consider the advantages of different capital structures.</p>

<p>You can use an opportunity cost analysis to help you decide how to best capitalize a project. A projectâ capital structure is simply how a company finances its operations. Capital structure may involve a mix of long-term debt, short-term debt, and equity. Equity is the infusion of capital into a business through the sale of shares of common stock or preferred stock to investors.You can also use own companyâs resources, as savings. What does opportunity cost have to do with a businessâs capital structure? If you finance your capital through debt, you have to pay it back even if you arenât making any money.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.10</span> Fiscal Impact</h3>
<p>Depending on how structure is an EE investment can have: -Fiscal Impact by using: - Debt(debt is considered a cost of a company, so can be deducted); - Investment(also is possible to deduct, still depends one fiscal regulation</p>
<p>Also you increase Risk of bankruptcy if you have a higher debt level.</p>
<p>The cost of capital is not equal, meaning that you can use an weight the use of equity and debt.</p>
<p>For example the same 1000â¬ investment, if you funded 50% with debt, with 10%interest rate, meaning 50â¬, you can deduct these costs, so you would pay less corporate tax, if your EBITDA (earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) due to this characteristic.</p>
<p>Table</p>
<p>Observe this example to understand that the cost of capital is not equal, meaning that you can use a balance of equity and debt. For example the same 1000â¬ investment, the company may choose option A or option B. Option A considers that 50% of the investment is funded with debt, with 10%interest rate, while option B considers that the project is financed 100% by Equity (or own resources). In option A, it will be possible to deduct 50â¬ per year, but in option B this will not be possible, because only interest is considered as cost of Company. As a result, in option A the company will pay less tax (in this case 25% of EBITDA -earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). So, with option A, the company will have a higher Net Income (in this case of 12,5â¬ euros, compared to option B) due to the fiscal impact of debt</p>

</div>
<p>The investment in the power plant has an initial investment that will be done in year 0 (the present). We will be able to sell some electricity back to the grid and for that we will have some positive cash flow from sales, but there will be some operation and maintenance costs. We also need to ask for a loan to develop the project, so we will have some financing expenses throughout the years.</p>
<p>At the end, the balance between the investment, and the sales from power plant minus the expenses in operating and financing will generate sufficient cash flows not only to payback the investment in 3 years, but also to generate additional earnings. Now, of course this depends on the considered interest rate.</p>
<p>One important aspect in project evaluation is to look to the evolution of cash flows and not only to the final end result (NPV, IRR or Payback Period).</p>
<div id="liquidity-trap" class="section level3">

<p>Do I have working capital to secure is any future earning is delayed lead companies to stressful situations. Using again the same representation of Cash Flows and now imagine this planned cash flows. All seem ok, there is enough money to pay O&amp;M, financing activities and in year 5 IRR will be positive, meaning that you already repaid all financial investment</p>
<p>Imagine you have a malfunction that had two consequences: a)Needed to spend more money in O&amp;M and b) you were sole able to generate electricity, so you will have no sales in this year. c)How are going to pay for the financing activities?</p>
<p>This is the liquidity trap, when you may have a great balance sheet will future revenues streams, but if you have few liquid resources for the short run you may end in what is so called âFinancial Slackâ As a side effect, even if you are able to borrow money, you IRR will also be worse than forecasted and you will need to more time to have the expected return on investment (that at this point you understand that also carries a cost)</p>
<p>One of the most common traps is the liquidity trap than be framed as follows:</p>
<p>What is worse? Owing 100â¬ tomorrow or 1 â¬ today?</p>
<p>Imagine company A that has 0â¬ today but will receive 100â¬ tomorrow. The problem is if has to make payments today so, technically could A)ask for a loan(which carries costs)</p>

<p>This is called the liquidity trap, when your balance sheet with future revenues streams looks good, but if you have few liquid resources for the short run you may end by failing your duties. In this case, for example, if you need to borrow additional money, you NPV will also be worse than forecasted and you will need to more time to have the expected return on investment. If you ha</p>
<p>You already understand cash flows still there are some details you should consider: A Cash Flow is a stream of income (money) into or out of a business, project, or financial product measured during a specified, limited period of time. It corresponds to a stream of income, where can change if you increase sales, or price or increase or decrease costs, as savings.</p>
<p>So when looking do a cash flow statement,</p>
<p>We can see:</p>
<p>Revenues of Sales, or how much money in coming in,</p>
<p>Investment, meaning money spent on investments activities)</p>
<p>Operations, usually referred as Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) and Financing.</p>
<p>In green are all inflows of money, in red the outflows, so, breaking down per year, a typical investment, demands high capital investment in year 0 and if you donÂ´t have, you may ask for a loan. So in year 0 you have a loan that goes to investment activities. In year 1 you will have inflows of money from sales, but you also have to pay for O&amp;M and financing activities.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you notice, your IRR will go from a negative one to a positive one. As you may notice, if donÂ´t have enough inflows of cash to pay for O&amp;M or Financing, you would end in a ânegativeâ net cash flow position, meaning that you are not generating enough income to pay for your activities.</p>
<p>Coming back to the example of the PV System project, imagine that in Year 3, there is a stop in the production. This has two consequences: the money for Operation and Maintenance will increase, there will be no sales, so we how are we going to pay for the financing activities?</p>

<div id="levelized-cost-of-energy-lcoe" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)</h3>
<p>The LCOE Measures lifetime costs divided by energy production or:</p>
<p>â¢ Calculates present value of the total cost of building and operating a power plant over an assumed lifetime. â¢ Allows the comparison of different technologies (e.g., wind, solar, natural gas) of unequal life spans, project size, different capital cost, risk, return, and capacities</p>
<p>It is quite similar to the NPV formula, where:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[LCOE = \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{I_t+M_t+F_t}{(1+r)^t}\]</span></p>
<p>It = Investment expenditures in year t (including financing) Mt = Operations and maintenance expenditures in year t Ft = Fuel expenditures in year t Et = Electricity generation in year t r = Discount rate n = Life of the system Note on degrading factor</p>
<p>If the fuel also releases CO2 you also have to consider (if industrial) the EU ETS Allowances (or other,depending on the countries regulation).</p>
<p>Focusing on the variable cost, the CO2 main price driver is the âFuel Switching costâ and coal forwards (coal releases more CO2) and gas forwards, having a direct impact on power prices.</p>
<p>The price dynamic in the emissions market is driven by the power sector.</p>
<p>At the end, it gives a metric of the cost of energy by implementing the projects, so the project with the lowest LCOE should in principle be more advantageous.</p>
<p>For energy generation projects like PV Power plants, or energy savings project (like changing the lighting system), the LCOE is quite similar to the NPV formula and represents the ration between the stream of cash Flows to generate the electricity (or saving electricity) during n years divided by the energy produced (or consumed) during that period.</p>
<p>For example for the PV System project, where its have a 1 y term (for simplicity), the LCOE would be:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image9.png" style="width:100.0%" />

<p>The Initial Costs Including Financing (100â¬), plus Annual Expenses (10â¬) (if you have more years, would be the projects O&amp;M), or 110â¬ of costs.</p>
<p>Imagine that generates 1000kWh per year, so the costs of each would be 0.11â¬/kWh.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Cost-Optimaly Methodology</h3>
<p>The Cost-Optimaly Methodology gives all relevant definitions needed to make the cost-optimum calculations and analyses of the implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings.</p>
<p>It is defined as technologically neutral and does not favour one technological solution over another. It ensures a competition of measures/ packages/ variants over the estimated lifetime of a building or building elementâ.</p>
<p>The global cost must be calculated according to EN15459 as indicated in the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_{g}(\tau) = C_I \sum{_j}[ \sum_{i=1}^{\tau}(C_{a,i(j)} \cdot R_d(i)) - C_{f\tau}(j)]\]</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>Cg(t) are the Global costs referring to the starting year Ï=0 Cl are the Initial investment costs Ca,i(j) are the annual costs year i for energy-related component j (energy costs, operational costs, periodic or replacement costs, maintenance costs) Rd(i) is the discount rate for year i (depending on interest rate) (minus) Vf,Ï(j) is the final value of component j at the end of the calculation period (referred to the starting year Ï=0 ).</p>
<p>The cost-optimum calculations are based on a net present value calculation.</p>
<p>According to Boermans, BettgenhÃ¤user et al., 2011 ( Cost-optimal building performance requirements - Calculation methodology to report on national energy performance requirements on the basis of cost-optimality within the framework of the EPBD, eceee).</p>
<p>when we discuss the cost-optimal levels and the effort to achieve energy savings, only the lower boundary of the cloud is interesting to identify the cost-optimal level. In case of a flat cost-curve, it was suggested to set the requirements in the lower (left) part of the calculated cost-optimal points. This will ensure that the most energy-efficient solution sets are selected. On the other hand, one should also try to avoid going too far on the left side of the curve, as cost-curves often show a tendency of a steep increase in costs when moving to the far left.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Scenario and Risk Analysis</h2>
<div id="risk-and-uncertainty" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Risk and uncertainty</h3>
<p>When referring to risk, most relates to the idea if certainty (or the lack of it) and or high or low volatility.</p>
<p>You understand that a deposit is safer than investing in the stock market. For the last you will demand a higher return, or risk premium (usually is equal to risk free rate plus a certain risk on top of that). The later carries higher risk, that could mean you could lose all you invested money (and more if you add some complex financial products).</p>
</div>
<div id="financial-risk-and-operational-risk" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> financial risk and operational risk</h3>
<p>It also refer to safety and reliability. In engineering usually it is referred to risk as something you have to mitigate to guarantee a certain level or safety, efficiency or other parameter or, to have safe gauge in the case that something fails. As a control system that may stop some task, send an alarm an so on.</p>
<p>So you have financial risk and operational risk, referring to the implementation and operations of a certain investment.</p>
<p>Understanding risk, means understanding exposure, or what type of events could change you basic underlying assumptions</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical and operational risk;</li>
<li>Regulatory risk;</li>
<li>Market Risk;</li>
<li>Financial Risk;</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example if you run your projections assuming a certain amount of sales and a small change will set to unprofitability, so running several scenarios will help you understand how exposed you are to a change of the demanded volume.</p>
<p>A change in regulation will set more companies working on the same space so setting cannibalism behaviors (as dumping);</p>
<p>First you start by acknowledging the event, then mitigate or (trying to) by different strategies. You may also choose to pursue option in less probability to being exposed to a certain risk</p>
<p>One of the most common ones relies on technical and operational risk, or how often projects access that the initial parameters still hold.</p>
<p>Basic example is can be described as follows:</p>
<p>Certain manufacturer states stat a certain equipment works for a determined use and need repairs and maintenance every x year of other parameter. Project managers wants to âmaximize profit and its being working fine until now, nothing seems wrongâ so will save a few Euros and delaying replacement of some fundamental pieces or maintenance and looks great on the financial documents. Until a certain day where either have a huge accident or the systems breaks.</p>
<p>Itâs the typical fat tail risk where from previous observations, everything will look âaverageââ¦ in historical data. If you discard that some things will not decrease efficiency, just go from one state to other, because reached a breaking point (or change of state).</p>
<p>Considering corporate finance, risk is priced ,usually by the Beta Coefficient of the CAPM model, that coupons the minimum return adjusted to risk</p>

<div id="due-diligence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.3</span> Due diligence</h3>
<p>Due diligence is verifying that all statements are true, this means verifying all assumptions prior and then you should have proper compliance mechanism to avoid having misrepresentation of the facts.</p>
<p>Projects are run by humans and humans (and machines) make errors, so you always should have systems to track errors, not dependent in a single person.</p>
<p>This is why you order audits to third parties which has 2 effects: People will perform differently in they know someone else will verifying;</p>
<p>If more than on person or entity will check the project, you will have lower probability of missing some critical element or information.</p>
<p>Narrowed Due diligence so as corporate governance structure can mitigate opportunist behaviors, misrepresentation of facts or important element important to make any investment decision.</p>

<div id="externalities" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.4</span> Externalities</h3>
<p>Finally, you can also consider other metrics, as environment impact (as carbon footprint) and social impact in these projects.</p>
<p>So you also can incorporate on the initial goals so as quantifying such metrics so as risks.</p>
