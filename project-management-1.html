<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Economic and financial dimensions</h3>
<p>Projects evaluation can be described as a methodology for assessing the economic and financial (and social and environmental) impact of a proposed investment.</p>
<p>Project evaluation should focus on two dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An <strong>Economic analysis</strong>, which is a systematic approach to determine the optimum use of resources (capital, human resources) and it involves the comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective under certain assumptions and constraints. In particular, it attempts to measure in monetary terms the costs and benefits of the project to the organization or the community or economy.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Financial analysis</strong>, which aims to determine the financial resources to develop the project, like choosing the funding sources (equity or debt).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When we refer to the economic analysis of a project, we are most of the times referring to the idea of the Opportunity Cost of a given decision.</p>
</div>
<div id="opportunity-cost" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Opportunity cost</h3>
<p>The opportunity cost is the benefit or value that you give up by choosing one option over another. In other words, the opportunity cost of a decision is the difference between the value you receive from pursuing a certain option and the value that you would have received from the alternative that you chose not to pursue.</p>
<p>We can express opportunity cost in terms of a return (or profit) on investment by using the following mathematical formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Opportunity \ Cost = Return \ on \ most \  Profitable \ Investment \ Choice - Return \ on \ Investment \  Chosen  \ to  \ Pursue\]</span></p>
<p>Unless the investment returns are fixed and guaranteed to be paid (like a Treasury bond you intend to hold to maturity), youâll have to base your calculation on the expected returns.</p>
<p>Example: imagine you want to buy an efficient equipment.</p>
<p>You have two potential options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change lighting system to LED (20% return on investment) or,</li>
<li>Installing a PV system (10% return on investment).</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the opportunity cost?</p>
<p>If you decide to leave install a new PV system, the opportunity cost is:</p>
<p>20% (changing the lighting system) - 10% (installing the pv system, option that is being pursuit) = 10%</p>
<p><br />
The opportunity cost is the difference between the benefits you would get from the one option (e.g.Â Change lighting system to LED) over another (installing a PV system).</p>
<p>This is your trade off for choosing one option instead of another.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-value-of-money" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Time value of money</h3>
<p>When dealing with financial investments one of the basic underlying issues emerges from answering the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you prefer to have 100â¬ today or invest 100â¬ for a future income?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of time is quite fundamental in finance, because in general, the money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future, due to its potential earning capacity.</p>
<p><br />
Time value of money can reflect that a certain amount of money today has a different buying power (value) than the same currency amount of money in the future, but is not an equivalent.</p>
<p><br />
If you consider as geometric series, the first term would be the present value, the common ratio would be <span class="math inline">\((1+i)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, number of periods.</p>
<p>So we start by this basic formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Future\ Value = Present \ Value \cdot (1+i)^n\]</span></p>
<p>Or the present Value of a certain amount of money C (at n year) is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Present\ Value = \frac{C}{(1+i)^n}\]</span></p>
<p>If we want to estimate how much is the Present value of a certain future cash flows C that will be collected in the future ânâ year,</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> - Net amount of money (cash-flows) that goes in or out of a project</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of compounding periods between the present date and the date where the sum is worth C</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the interest rate for one compounding period (the end of a compounding period is when interest is applied, for example, annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily).</p>
<p>(The interest rate i is given as a percentage, but expressed as a decimal in this formula. If using periods with less than one year, for example 6 month would be power of Â½ or 6/12)</p>
<p><br />
Compounding is the process where the value of an investment increases because the earnings on an investment, both capital gains and interest, earn interest as time passes. This exponential growth occurs because the total growth of an investment along with its principal earn money in the next period. This differs from linear growth, where only the principal earns interest each period.</p>
<p><br />
If you consider as geometric series, the first term would be the present value, the common ratio would be <span class="math inline">\((1+i)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, number of periods.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image1.jpg" title="Geometric growth" alt="Geometric growth" style="width:100.0%" />
<p class="caption">Geometric growth</p>
</div>
<p>If you notice, more than the interest rate, times plays a central role, or what so called the power compound interest, so you are dealing with geometric growth, not linear and the reasoning can be linked to the idea of trade-offs. You will defer consumption today, to have a certain return in n years, but because you just will have that return in n years it is like if you were reinvesting every year.</p>
<p><br />
Example:</p>
<p>year 0, you have 100â¬</p>
<p>year 1, you would have 100+1.10 (10% rate),</p>
<p>year 2, you start with 110 (and not 100 â¬) so you will have 121 (110*1.1) and so on.</p>
<p>Another way to put is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is would you choose?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>100â¬ today or;</li>
<li>103â¬ in 1 year</li>
</ol>
<p>If you consider a 4% interest rate</p>
<p>We would level both options with the previous formula</p>
<p>So option 1 would be equivalent to:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(100 \times (1.04)^1\)</span> or 104â¬</p>
<p>or doing for present value</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(C_0 =103/104 = 99â¬\)</span></p>
<p>So 100â¬ are equal to 104â¬ in 1 year and 103â¬ in 1 year time is equivalent to 99â¬ today.</p>
<p>The time value of money is the assumption that money can generate value if it is invested (for example interests in a bank), so it is better to receive the money now than later.</p>
<p>At the end, the same amount of money today has a different and higher buying power (value) than the same amount of money in the future, it is not an equivalent.</p>
<p>The rate at which the money is appreciate or depreciate is called the discount rate. This discount rate may represent different factors but is often considered to be the interest rate given by the treasury bounds of central banks at 10 years, usually are used as benchmark (risk free) to computed riskier investments. It is often represented by the letter âiâ of interest.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(1010=1000\times(1+0.01), with \ n=1\)</span></p>
<p>Imagine that you have 1000â¬ and you put in the bank with a 1% interest rate. In one year, the 1000 euros you have today will be worth 1010â¬.</p>
<p>In 2 years it will be worth 1020.1â¬.</p>
<p>If we want to estimate how much is the Present value of a certain future cash flows C that will be collected in the future ânâ year, we can invert the future value formula and:</p>
<p>example 3:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(990.01=1000/(1+0.01)\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span></p>
<p>Imagine that you have the opportunity to collect 1000â¬ in one year.</p>
<p>That is equivalent to receiving today only 990.01 â¬ (because if you put in the bank today 990.01 â¬), you will have 1000 euros next year.</p>

<div id="money" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> Money</h3>
<p>Money can also be defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Itâs a <strong>store of value</strong>, meaning that money allows you to defer consumption until a later date.</li>
<li>Itâs a <strong>unit of account</strong>, meaning that it allows you to assign a value to different goods without having to compare them. So instead of saying that a car is worth ten cows, you can just say it (or the cows) cost 10 000 â¬.</li>
<li>And itâs <strong>a medium of exchange</strong> âan easy and efficient way for you and me and others to trade goods and services with one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea that a euro today is worth more than a euro tomorrow, relates more to the second and last roles, storage and medium of exchange, because the value of money at a future point of time would take account of interest earned and the inflation accrued over a given period of time.</p>
<p>Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation, and avoid deflation, in order to keep the economy running smoothly, namely by setting interest rates.</p>

<div id="indicators" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Indicators</h2>
<p>Basic indicators that should be computed to evaluate a project and aid in the decision of developing it or not: net present value, internal rate of return and payback period.</p>
<div id="net-present-value-npv" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Net Present Value (NPV)</h3>
<p>The first indicator to evaluate a project, is the Net Present Value (NPV), which basically estimates the value that will be gained at present costs by developing the project. This estimate consists in adding all future net earnings (the cashflows) minus the initial investment that is required to execute the project.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[NPV_{i, N}  \sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} - Investment\]</span></p>
<p>Net present value (NPV) of a project is the potential change in an investorâs wealth caused by that project while time value of money is being accounted for. It equals the present value of net cash inflows generated by a project less the initial investment on the project. It is one of the most reliable measures used in capital budgeting because it accounts for time value of money by using discounted cash flows in the calculation.</p>
<p>Net present value calculations take the following two inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Projected net cash flows in successive periods from the project.</p></li>
<li><p>A target rate of return i.e.Â the discount rate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>Net cash flow equals total cash inflow during a period, less cash outflows from the project during the period.</p>
<p>Discount rate is the rate used to discount the net cash inflows. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)is the most commonly used discount rate.</p>
<p><img src="Images/image2.png" style="width:100.0%" /> <strong>Decision Rule</strong></p>
<p>In case of standalone projects, accept a project only if its NPV is positive, reject it if its NPV is negative and stay indifferent between accepting or rejecting if NPV is zero. In case of mutually exclusive projects (i.e.Â competing projects), accept the project with higher NPV.</p>
<p><strong>NPV (even and uneven)</strong></p>
<p>The net cash flows may be even (i.e.Â equal cash flows in different periods) or uneven (i.e.Â different cash flows in different periods).</p>
<p>When they are even, present value can be easily calculated by using the formula for present value of annuity. However, if they are uneven, we need to calculate the present value of each individual net cash inflow separately.</p>
<p>Once we have the total present value of all project cash flows, we subtract the initial investment on the project from the total present value of inflows to arrive at net present value.</p>
<p>Thus we have the following two formulas for the calculation of NPV:</p>
<p>When cash inflows are even:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(NPV = C Ã 1 â (1 + i)-n â Initial Investment\)</span></p>
<p>In the above formula, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the net cash inflow expected to be received in each period; <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the required rate of return per period; <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are the number of periods during which the project is expected to operate and generate cash inflows.</p>
<p>When cash inflows are uneven:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(NPV = C1 + C2 + C3 + ... â Initial \ Investment\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_1:(1 + i)^1\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_2:(1 + i)^2\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_3:(1 + i)^3\)</span></p>
<p>Where, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the target rate of return per period; <span class="math inline">\(R1\)</span> is the net cash inflow during the first period; <span class="math inline">\(R2\)</span> is the net cash inflow during the second period; <span class="math inline">\(R3\)</span> is the net cash inflow during the third period, and so on â¦</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>Example 1: Even Cash Inflows</p>
<p>Calculate the net present value of a project which requires an initial investment of $243,000 and it is expected to generate a cash inflow of $50,000 each month for 12 months. Assume that the salvage value of the project is zero. The target rate of return is 12% per annum.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Initial Investment = $243,000</p>
<p>Net Cash Inflow per Period = $50,000</p>
<p>Number of Periods = 12</p>
<p>Discount Rate per Period = 12% Ã· 12 = 1%</p>

<p>Example 2: Uneven Cash Inflows:</p>
<p>An initial investment of $8,320 thousand on plant and machinery is expected to generate cash inflows of $3,411 thousand, $4,070 thousand, $5,824 thousand and $2,065 thousand at the end of first, second, third and fourth year respectively. At the end of the fourth year, the machinery will be sold for $900 thousand. Calculate the net present value of the investment if the discount rate is 18%. Round your answer to nearest thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Solution</p>

<div id="strengths-and-weaknesses-of-npv" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.1</span> Strengths and Weaknesses of NPV</h4>
<p><em>Strengths</em></p>
<p>Net present value accounts for time value of money which makes it a sounder approach than other investment appraisal techniques which do not discount future cash flows such payback period and accounting rate of return. Net present value is even better than some other discounted cash flows techniques such as IRR. In situations where IRR and NPV give conflicting decisions, NPV decision should be preferred.</p>
<p><em>Weaknesses</em></p>
<p>NPV is after all an estimation. It is sensitive to changes in estimates for future cash flows, salvage value and the cost of capital. Net present value does not take into account the size of the project. For example, say Project A requires initial investment of $4 million to generate NPV of $1 million while a competing Project B requires $2 million investment to generate an NPV of $0.8 million. If we base our decision on NPV alone, we will prefer Project A because it has higher NPV, but Project B has generated more shareholdersâ wealth per dollar of initial investment ($0.8 million/$2 million vs $1 million/$4 million).</p>

<div id="internal-rate-of-return-irr" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</h3>
<p>The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), corresponds to finding out what is the rate of return of the project that makes the NPV equal to 0.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[IRR=  \sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Imagine you want to develop this project, but one of two things may happen:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>you need to go to a bank, ask for a loan and will have to pay an interest rate of 5%;</li>
<li>you need to take the money from the bank and will loose a 5% interest rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the IRR is higher than this (5%), it means you should develop the project, as the value that you will get from the project is higher that what you need to invest.</p>
</div>
<div id="payback-period" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Payback Period</h3>
<p>Lastly, sometimes you want to know how much is the period of time required for the return on an investment to ârepayâ the sum of the original investment.</p>
<p>So the simple formula to answer that question is given as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Payback \, Period = \frac{Amount\,Invested}{Estimated\,Net\,Cash\,Flow}\]</span></p>
<p>The payback can be calculated in a simplified way â where the time value of money is not taken into account - or in a discounted way, where the net cash flows are calculated using the present cost (discounted payback period).</p>
<p>Project evaluation should never be only based on the analysis of one single indicator. Only the combined analysis of all indicators, will provide enough information to take a well informed decision.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Cash Flows</h2>
<div id="nature" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Nature</h3>
<p>As we mention, the cashflow is the net balance between positive and negative money flows in the project. When we are dealing with project evaluation we can split the money flows between costs and revenues, by nature in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investment (value used to buy an asset required to the project)</li>
<li>Operating (value used to operate the asset required to the project)</li>
<li>Financing (The investment costs are related to how much is it necessary to spend to generate future revenues)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the energy field, this is the investment necessary to increase energy savings (e.g.Â changing the lighting system or install a new monitoring system) or eventually to get some revenue (e.g.Â Installing a PV system that can back sell to the grid the excess)</p>
<p>The cash flow is the net balance of all the revenues and costs, regardless of their nature (financing, operating or investment)</p>
<p>In a project evaluation it should be always positive, as it means that the revenues are larger than the expenses.</p>
</div>
<div id="fix-costs-and-variable-costs" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Fix costs and variable costs</h3>
<p>You also can spilt by:</p>
<p>Fix costs and variable costs.</p>
<p>A variable cost and fixed cost are the two main costs a company has when producing goods and services. A companyâs total cost is composed of its total fixed costs and its total variable costs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Variable costs vary with the amount produced.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed costs remain the same, no matter how much output a company produces.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/imagem3.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>A variable cost is a companyâs cost that is associated with the amount of goods or services it produces. A companyâs variable cost increases and decreases with the production volume. For example, suppose company ABC produces light bulbs for a cost of â¬2 a light bulb. If the company produces 500 units, its variable cost will be â¬1,000.</p>
<p>However, if the company does not produce any units, it will not have any variable cost for producing the light bulb.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a fixed cost does not vary with the volume of production.</p>
<p>A fixed cost does not change with the amount of goods or services a company produces. It remains the same even if no goods or services are produced. Using the same example above, suppose company ABC has a fixed cost of 10,000 per month for the machine it uses to produce light bulbs. If the company does not produce any light bulbs for the month, it would still have to pay 10,000 for the cost of renting the machine. On the other hand, if it produces 1 million light bulbs, its fixed cost remains the same. The variable costs change from zero to $2 million in this example.</p>
</div>
<div id="break-even-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Break even analysis</h3>
<p>We can relate Total Costs and its Fix and Variable Costs to answer a simple question:</p>
<p>How many units do I have to sale to pay for the Fix Costs? Or to Break even?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image4.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p><span class="math display">\[Fixed \ Costs Ã· (Price - Variable\ Costs) = Breakeven\ Point\ in \ Units\]</span></p>
<p>Where you divide the Fix Costs by the difference between Price and Variable Costs, that can also the the Cost of goods Sold,</p>
<p>The result is the Breakeven Point in Units, meaning how many units you have to sell to pay for the fix Costs.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image5.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>If you look to the chart, you can see the BEP, or the equilibrium point of the Total revenues curve and Total Cost Curve, where any value on the left, mean that you be in loss region, and on the right profitable region.</p>
</div>
<div id="cash-flows-in-ee" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> Cash Flows in EE</h3>
<p>In energy efficiency, the cash flows have a special nature as they in general they do not represent a real money inflow to the company, but rather a smaller expense or outflow. When we implement an energy efficiency measure, we do not receive money for it (except in few cases, like selling electricity to the grid), but we spend less money in energy.</p>
<p>Most will assume that savings, namely in EE projects are equal to future earnings (or a future stream of cash flows), but you should be aware that is not, namely:</p>
<p>Savings means fewer costs, not more revenues;</p>
<p>Means that unless you take those savings and invest in a similar project with a similar stream of cash flows, you canÂ´t compound negative value (or for simplicity, assume that you can only compound values greater than 0).</p>
<p>You will have to make payments in the future, namely if under a EPC Contract, so when looking to an EE investment you better consider as an investment, where you may have to pay something upfront the rest delayed in future payment and in the future (after payment the investment) you will have to use fewer funds for energy.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image6.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>So you can consider as net flows of inflows and outflows of money, where EE measure will impact the outflows, still, if the outflows are 0 (you donât spend any in energy, means that you will have 0 savings because thereâs no efficiency to apply to outflows.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.5</span> Financial Statements</h3>
<p>The Relationship Between the Financial Statements</p>
<p>The income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement are all interrelated.</p>
<p>The income statement describes how the assets and liabilities were used in the stated accounting period.</p>
<p>The cash flow statement explains cash inflows and outflows, and it will ultimately reveal the amount of cash the company has on hand, which is also reported in the balance sheet. By themselves, each financial statement only provides a portion of the story of a companyâs financial condition; together, they provide a more complete picture.</p>
<p>In the context of corporate financial reporting, the income statement summarizes a companyâs revenues (sales) and expenses, quarterly and annually for its fiscal year. The final net figure, as well as various other numbers in the statement, are of major interest to the investment community.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.6</span> Investments</h3>
<p>A capital expenditure, or CAPEX, is considered an investment into the business. The money spent is not immediately reported on the income statement; rather, it is treated as an asset on the balance sheet. A CAPEX is deducted over the course of several years as a depreciation expense, beginning with the year following the purchase. The depreciation expense is reported on the income statement in the tax years it is deducted, resulting in reduced profit.</p>
<p>For example, say you own a flower shop and in 2012, you purchase a delivery van for â¬ 30,000. The van is recorded as an asset on 2012âs balance sheet, leaving the income statement for 2012 unaffected by the purchase. You expect to use the van for six years, so it is depreciated by â¬5,000 each year. So, on 2013âs income statement, a $5,000 expense is then reported. While a CAPEX does not directly affect income statements in the year of purchase, for each subsequent year for the expected useful life of the asset the depreciation expense affects the income statement.</p>
<p>A CAPEX may indirectly have an immediate effect on income statements depending on the type of asset that is acquired. Using the previous example, the van purchased for the flower shop is not recorded on the income statement for 2012, but gas and insurance expenses for the van are considered business expenses that affect the income statement. However, the expenses incurred by the van may be offset by the increase in revenue produced by the delivery van.</p>
<p>A cash position represents the amount of cash that a company, investment fund or bank has on its books at a specific point in time. The cash position is a sign of financial strength and liquidity. In addition to cash itself, this position often takes into consideration highly liquid assets, such as certificates of deposit, short-term government debt and other cash equivalents.</p>

<div id="annuities" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.7</span> Annuities</h3>
<p>An annuity is a form of investment involving a series of periodic equal contributions made by an individual to an account for a specified term. Interest may be compounded at the end or beginning of each period. The term annuity is also used for a series of regular payments made to an individual for a specified time, such as in the case of a pension. The word annuity comes from the word âannualâ meaning yearly. Pension funds involve making contributions to an annuity before retirement and receiving payments from an annuity after retirement. Calculations can be made to find out</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>What a certain contribution per period amounts to as a fund</li>
<li>What size of contribution needs to be made to create of fund of a specific amount</li>

<p>When receiving payments from an annuity the present value of the annuity is the lump sum that must be invested now in order to provide those regular payments over the term.</p>
<p>Examples of annuities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly rent payments</li>
<li>Regular deposits in a savings account</li>
<li>Social welfare benefits</li>
<li>Annual premiums for a life insurance policy</li>
<li>Periodic payments to a retired person from a pension fund</li>
<li>Dividend payments on stocks and shares</li>
<li>Loan repayments</li>

<p>We are interested in the value of the annuity at time 0, (the present value), and the accumulated value of the annuity at time n (the future value).</p>
<p>Suppose the rate of interest per period is i, and we assume the compound-interest method applies.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_{ni}\)</span> denote the present value of the annuity, which is sometimes denoted as <span class="math inline">\(a_{n}\)</span> when the rate of interest is understood.</p>
<p>As the present value of the jth payment is <span class="math inline">\(v^{j}\)</span>, where v = 1/(1+i) is the discount factor, the present value of the annuity is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a_{n}= v + v^{2} + v^{3}+...+ v^{n}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(= v \times\left [ \frac{1-v^n}{1-v} \right ]\)</span></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.7.2</span> Amortisation and amortised loans</h4>
<p>The process of accounting for a sum of money by making it equivalent to a series of payments over time, such as arises when paying off a debt over time is called amortisation. Accordingly, a loan that involves paying back a fixed amount at regular intervals over a fixed period of time is called an amortised loan. Term loans and annuity mortgages (as opposed to endowment mortgages) are examples of amortised loans.</p>
</div>
<div id="regular-payments-over-time-geometric-series" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.7.3</span> Regular payments over time â geometric series</h4>
<p>Arrangements involving savings and loans often involve making a regular payment at fixed intervals of time. For example, a âregular savingsâ account might involve saving a certain amount of money every month for a number of years. A term loan or a mortgage might involve borrowing a certain amount of money and repaying it in equal instalments over time.</p>
<p>Calculations involving such regular payment schedules, when they are considered in terms of the present values of the payments as in loans will involve the summation of a geometric series.</p>
</div>
<div id="amortised-loan-example" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.7.4</span> Amortised loan example</h4>
<p>When regular payments are being used to pay off a loan, then we are usually interested in calculating their present values (value right now) rather than their future values, because this is the basis upon which the loan repayments and/or the interest rate are calculated.</p>
<p>We have seen that the APR is the interest rate for which the present value of all the repayments is equal to the present value of the loan. In the case of an amortised loan, these present values form a consistent pattern that turns out to be a geometric series.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>A borrows â¬10,000 at an interest rate of 6%. He wants to repay it in five equal instalments over five years, with the first repayment one year after he takes out the loan. How much should each repayment be?</p>
<p>Solution Let each repayment equal A. Then the present value of the first repayment is A/1.06, the present value of the second repayment is A/1.062, and so on. The total of the present values of all the repayments is equal to the loan amount.</p>
<p>Total of the present values of all the repayments <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A}{1.06} + \frac{A}{1.06^2} + ........ \frac{A}{1.06^5}\)</span></p>
<p>This is a geometric series, with n = 5,first term <span class="math inline">\(a=\frac{A}{1.06}\)</span> and common ratio <span class="math inline">\(r=\frac{A}{1.06}\)</span></p>
<p>The sum of the first 5 terms which is the loan amount is <span class="math inline">\(S_5= \frac{ \frac{A}{1.06} \left ( 1- \frac{A}{1.06^5} \right ) } { \left ( 1- \frac{A}{1.06} \right )} = 4.212363786A\)</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(S_5\)</span> has to equal the loan amount of â¬10,000, then <span class="math inline">\(A = \frac{10 000}{4.212363786} = â¬ 2373.96\)</span></p>
<p>(could find <span class="math inline">\(s_{n}\)</span> for a small number of terms by adding the terms individually first and then checking their answer by using the formula for Sn of a geometric series.)</p>
<p>This type of calculation is so common that it is convenient to derive a formula to shortcut the calculation for the regular repayment A. By considering the general case of an amortised loan with interest rate i, taken out over t years, for a loan amount of P, a geometric series can be used to derive the general formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A= P\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)^t-1}\]</span> This formula gives the same result as (i) above: A = 10000</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A= 10 000\frac{0.06(1.06)^5}{(1.06)^5-1}= â¬2373.96\]</span></p>
<p>(The formula assumes payment at the end of each payment period.)</p>
</div>
<div id="amortisation-formula" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.7.5</span> Amortisation formula</h4>
<p>Terms associated with the amortisation formula revisited:</p>
<p>Present Value is the value on a given date of a future payment or series of future payments discounted to reflect the time value of money and other factors such as investment risk.</p>
<p>An annuity is a series of equal payments or receipts that occur at evenly spaced intervals. Each payment occurs at the end of each period for an ordinary annuity.</p>
<p>An amortised loan is a loan for which the loan amount plus interest is paid off in a series of regular payments. An amortised loan is an annuity whose future value is the same as the loan amountâs future value, under compound interest. An amortised loanâs payments are used to pay off a loan. Other types of annuitiesâ payments can be used to generate savings as for example for retirement funds.</p>
<p>We can think of the situation in two ways which give the same end result:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The sum of the present values of all the annual repayment amounts = sum borrowed. (This principle is enshrined in European Law)</p></li>
<li><p>Future value of loan amount = Future value of the annual repayment amounts (i.e.Â future value of the annuity)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Given that A = annual repayment amount, the present value of one annual repayment amount paid in t years time is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P= \frac{A}{(1+i)^t}\)</span>,where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the annual rate of interest expressed as a decimal or fraction</p>
<p>So if I borrow â¬10,000 over 5 years, when I add up the present values of all the annual repayment amounts, this sum should equal â¬10,000.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(10 0000 = \frac{A}{(1+i)} + \frac{A}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{A}{(1+i)^3} + \frac{A}{(1+i)^4} + \frac{A}{(1+i)^5} = A =\frac{1}{(1+i)} + \frac{1}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{1}{(1+i)^3} + \frac{1}{(1+i)^4}+ \frac{1}{(1+i)^5}\)</span></p>
<p>Two methods of deriving the âAmortisation â mortgages and loansâ formula</p>
<p>Loan amount = sum of the present value of all the repayments (assuming payment at the end of each payment period) P = Loan amount , A = periodic repayment amount, t = the number of payment periods i = the interest rate for the payment period expressed as a decimal or fraction</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A =\frac{1}{(1+i)} + \frac{1}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{1}{(1+i)^3} + .... \frac{1}{(1+i)^t}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P=S_n\)</span> of a geometric series , n = t = number of compounding periods , <span class="math inline">\(a =\frac{A}{(1+i)^n}\)</span> , <span class="math inline">\(r =\frac{1}{(1+i)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P=\frac{a(1-r^n)}{(1-r)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[=\frac{\frac{A}{(1+i)}}{(1-r)},\frac{1-(1+i)^t}{(1+i)}{(1-r)}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A=P\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)-1}\)</span></p>
<p>Method 2 The future value of the loan amount P = sum of the future values of t equal repayments each of value A made at the end of each compounding period.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P=(1+i)^t= A(1+i)^{-t} + A(1+i)^{-2t}+.......A(1+i)^{-t}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P(1+i)^t=S_n\)</span>, of a geometric series</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S_n= \frac{a(1-r^n)}{(1-r)}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a= A\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(r=1+i,n=t\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P=(1+i)^t =\frac{A((1+i)^{t}-1}{(1+i)-1}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P=(1+i)^t=\frac{A((1+i)^{t}-1}{i}\)</span></p>

<p>Assuming a loan is repaid in fixed annual repayments â the annual repayment is made up of two parts â one part interest and the remainder is part of the capital sum borrowed, called âprincipal portionâ in the graph below. The graphs below show that that even though the periodic payment is fixed, the part of it which is interest is decreasing as more of the loan is paid off and the part of it which is principal is increasing. The graph below refers to an amortisation schedule for a loan paid back monthly over 360 months.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.8</span> Capital Structure</h3>
<p>The way you decide to finance the project (Capital Structure) plays a central role in Financial Analysis.</p>
<p>What is the Basic Accounting Equation?</p>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Owners Equity</p>
<p>Double entry bookkeeping and accounting is based on the basic accounting equation which states that the total assets of a business must equal the total liabilities plus the owners equity in the business.</p>
<p>Enterprise value (EV) = Equity value (QV) + Net debt (ND)</p>
<p>One side represents the assets of the business (buildings, inventory, vehicles etc), and the other side represents how those assets were funded (capital, retained earnings, loans, supplier credit etc.). Notice that owners equity includes amounts invested by the owners (capital) and profits of the business which have been retained.</p>
<p>The basic accounting equation is true at any point in time for a business and is also true for each individual double entry transaction. For example, if the business buys furniture on credit from a supplier for 200 then the basic accounting equation is shown as follows.</p>
<p>Accounting Equation Assets = Liabilities + Equity Furniture = Accounts payable + None 200 = 200 + 0</p>
<p>The two sides of the basic accounting equation are equal. On one side is the furniture coming into the business as an asset, on the other side is the funding for the asset which in this case is credit from a supplier.</p>
<p>The Expanded Accounting Equation Since owners equity is made up from capital injected and retained earnings of the business, the basic accounting equation can be expanded as follows:</p>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Retained Earnings</p>
<p>In addition, retained earnings can be expanded to revenue less expenses less owners drawings, giving the fully expanded accounting equation shown below.</p>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Revenue - Expenses - Drawings</p>
<p>It should also be noted that since revenue less expenses is equal to the net income of the business for the period the accounting equation can also be stated as follows.</p>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Net income - Drawings The fully expanded accounting equation is summarized in the diagram below.</p>
<p>The owners drawings represent cash taken out of the business by way of salary, in a company this would be represented by dividends paid to the equity owners.</p>
<p>The expanded accounting equation effectively shows that retained earnings is the link between the balance sheet and the income statement. The income statement is in fact a further analysis of the equity of the business.</p>
<p>The expanded accounting equation diagram used in this tutorial is available for download in PDF format by following the link below.</p>
<p>Relationship Between Financial Statements The four main financial statements are used to show different aspects of a business. It is important to understand the relationship between financial statements as this allows a full understanding of the financial performance of the business when analyzing financial statements</p>
<p>The Four Financial Statements The 4 financial statements are as follows.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Balance Sheet â The balance sheet or statement of financial position, shows a financial snapshot of the assets, liabilities and equity of the business at a specific point in time.</p></li>
<li><p>Income Statement â The income statement shows the financial performance of the business over an accounting period in terms of its revenue, expenses, and net income.</p></li>
<li><p>Statement of Retained Earnings â The statement of retained earnings reconciles the beginning and ending retained earnings by adjusting for the net income and dividend distributions of the business.</p></li>
<li><p>Cash Flow Statement â The cash flow statement or statement of cash flows shows the cash inflow and cash outflow of the business over an accounting period.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Relationship Between Financial Statements The relationship between financial statements can be seen by reviewing the basic trading operations of a business.</p>

<p>You can use an opportunity cost analysis to help you decide how to best capitalize a project. A projectâ capital structure is simply how a company finances its operations. Capital structure may involve a mix of debt (long-term or short-term) and equity, and Equity, which is the infusion of capital into a business using the companyâs resources, such as savings or through the sale of shares.</p>
<p>If you finance your investment through DEBT, you have to pay it back even if you arenât making any money. Moreover, money allocated to servicing debt canât be spent on investing in the business or pursuing other investment opportunities. However, debt is considered to be a cost to a company, so can be deducted.</p>
<p>Using equity means that the financing costs may be lower, but it may compromise liquidity in this or other projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, remember that depending on the Energy Efficiency projects and the regulation of the country, some investments may have a positive fiscal Impact (e.g.Â tax abatement) or may give access to special credit. So at the end, the project evaluation should consider the advantages of different capital structures.</p>

<p>For example the same 1000â¬ investment, if you funded 50% with debt, with 10%interest rate, meaning 50â¬, you can deduct these costs, so you would pay less corporate tax, if your EBITDA (earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) due to this characteristic.</p>

<p>Observe this example to understand that the cost of capital is not equal, meaning that you can use a balance of equity and debt.</p>
<p>For example the same 1000â¬ investment, the company may choose option A or option B. Option A considers that 50% of the investment is funded with debt, with 10%interest rate, while option B considers that the project is financed 100% by Equity (or own resources).</p>
<p>In option A, it will be possible to deduct 50â¬ per year, but in option B this will not be possible, because only interest is considered as cost of Company. As a result, in option A the company will pay less tax (in this case 25% of EBITDA -earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization).</p>
<p>So, with option A, the company will have a higher Net Income (in this case of 12,5â¬ euros, compared to option B) due to the fiscal impact of debt</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Project Evaluation</h2>
<p>Now look at this example of a project of installing a PV power plant in our facility.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/image7.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>The investment in the power plant has an initial investment that will be done in year 0 (the present). We will be able to sell some electricity back to the grid and for that we will have some positive cash flow from sales, but there will be some operation and maintenance costs. We also need to ask for a loan to develop the project, so we will have some financing expenses throughout the years.</p>
<p>At the end, the balance between the investment, and the sales from power plant minus the expenses in operating and financing will generate sufficient cash flows not only to payback the investment in 3 years, but also to generate additional earnings. Now, of course this depends on the considered interest rate.</p>
<p>One important aspect in project evaluation is to look to the evolution of cash flows and not only to the final end result (NPV, IRR or Payback Period).</p>
<div id="liquidity-trap" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Liquidity trap</h3>
<p>The pitfall of just looking to NPV and not to cash flows or to answer the simple question: will I have enough funds to pay all committed obligations and?</p>
<p>Do I have working capital to secure is any future earning is delayed lead companies to stressful situations. Using again the same representation of Cash Flows and now imagine this planned cash flows. All seem ok, there is enough money to pay O&amp;M, financing activities and in year 5 IRR will be positive, meaning that you already repaid all financial investment</p>
<p>Imagine you have a malfunction that had two consequences: a)Needed to spend more money in O&amp;M and b) you were sole able to generate electricity, so you will have no sales in this year. c)How are going to pay for the financing activities?</p>
<p>This is the liquidity trap, when you may have a great balance sheet will future revenues streams, but if you have few liquid resources for the short run you may end in what is so called âFinancial Slackâ As a side effect, even if you are able to borrow money, you IRR will also be worse than forecasted and you will need to more time to have the expected return on investment (that at this point you understand that also carries a cost)</p>
<p>One of the most common traps is the liquidity trap than be framed as follows:</p>
<p>What is worse? Owing 100â¬ tomorrow or 1 â¬ today?</p>
<p>Imagine company A that has 0â¬ today but will receive 100â¬ tomorrow. The problem is if has to make payments today so, technically could:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><p>ask for a loan(which carries costs)</p></li>
<li><p>may be not able to secure such loan and technically would be bankrupt.</p></li>

<p>The pitfall of just looking to npv and not to cash flows or to answer the simple question:will I have enough funds to pay all committed obligations and? Do I have working capital to secure is any future earning is delayed lead companies to stressful situations.This is the liquidity trap, when you may have a great balance sheet will future revenues streams,but if you have few liquid resources for the short run you may end in what is so called âFinancial Slackâ</p>
<p>This is called the liquidity trap, when your balance sheet with future revenues streams looks good, but if you have few liquid resources for the short run you may end by failing your duties. In this case, for example, if you need to borrow additional money, you NPV will also be worse than forecasted and you will need to more time to have the expected return on investment. If you ha</p>
<p>You already understand cash flows still there are some details you should consider: A Cash Flow is a stream of income (money) into or out of a business, project, or financial product measured during a specified, limited period of time. It corresponds to a stream of income, where can change if you increase sales, or price or increase or decrease costs, as savings.</p>
<p>So when looking do a cash flow statement,</p>
<p>We can see:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Revenues of Sales, or how much money in coming in,</p></li>
<li><p>Investment, meaning money spent on investments activities)</p></li>
<li><p>Operations, usually referred as Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) and Financing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In green are all inflows of money, in red the outflows, so, breaking down per year, a typical investment, demands high capital investment in year 0 and if you donÂ´t have, you may ask for a loan. So in year 0 you have a loan that goes to investment activities. In year 1 you will have inflows of money from sales, but you also have to pay for O&amp;M and financing activities.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you notice, your IRR will go from a negative one to a positive one. As you may notice, if donÂ´t have enough inflows of cash to pay for O&amp;M or Financing, you would end in a ânegativeâ net cash flow position, meaning that you are not generating enough income to pay for your activities.</p>
<p>Coming back to the example of the PV System project, imagine that in Year 3, there is a stop in the production. This has two consequences: the money for Operation and Maintenance will increase, there will be no sales, so we how are we going to pay for the financing activities?</p>

<p>The ability to accurately predict power delivery over the course of time is of vital importance to the growth of the photovoltaic (PV) industry. Two key cost drivers are the efficiency with which sunlight is converted into power and how this relationship changes over time. An accurate quantification of power decline over time, also known as degradation rate, is essential to all stakeholdersâutility companies, integrators, investors, and researchers alike. Financially,degradation of a PV module or system is equally important, because a higher degradation rate translates directly into less power produced and, therefore, reduces future cash flows [1]. Furthermore, inaccuracies in determined degradation rates lead directly to increased financial risk [2]. Technically, degradation mechanisms are important to understand because they may eventually lead to failure [3]. Typically, a 20% decline is considered a failure, but there is no consensus on the definition of failure, because a high-efficiency module degraded by 50% may still have a higher efficiency than a non-degraded module from a less efficient technology. The identification of the underlying degradation mechanism through experiments and modeling can lead directly to lifetime improvements. Outdoor field testing has played a vital role in quantifying long-term behavior and lifetime for at least two reasons: it is the typical operating environment for PV systems, and it is the only way to correlate indoor accelerated testing to outdoor results to forecast field performance.</p>

<p>Increase in Costs:</p>
<p>The inflation rate is widely calculated by calculating the movement or change in a price index, usually the consumer price index.</p>
<p>A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the price level of market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households.</p>
<p>The CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically. Sub-indices and sub-sub-indices are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services, being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index. It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies. The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation. A CPI can be used to index (i.e., adjust for the effect of inflation) the real value of wages, salaries, pensions, for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values. In most countries, the CPI, along with the population census, is one of the most closely watched national economic statistics.</p>
<p>To illustrate the method of calculation, in January 2007, the U.S. Consumer Price Index was 202.416, and in January 2008 it was 211.080. The formula for calculating the annual percentage rate inflation in the CPI over the course of the year is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\displaystyle \left({\frac {211.080-202.416}{202.416}}\right)\times 100\%=4.28\%} \left({\frac {211.080-202.416}{202.416}}\right)\times 100\%=4.28\%\]</span></p>
<p>The resulting inflation rate for the CPI in this one-year period is 4.28%, meaning the general level of prices for typical U.S. consumers rose by approximately four percent in 2007.</p>
<p>Monetarists assert that the empirical study of monetary history shows that inflation has always been a monetary phenomenon. The quantity theory of money, simply stated, says that any change in the amount of money in a system will change the price level. This theory begins with the equation of exchange:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle MV=PQ \, MV=PQ}\)</span> where</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle M}\)</span> M is the nominal quantity of money; <span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle V}\)</span> V is the velocity of money in final expenditures; <span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle P}\)</span> P is the general price level; <span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle Q}\)</span> Q is an index of the real value of final expenditures; In this formula, the general price level is related to the level of real economic activity (Q), the quantity of money (M) and the velocity of money (V). The formula is an identity because the velocity of money (V) is defined to be the ratio of final nominal expenditure ( <span class="math inline">\({\displaystyle PQ}\)</span> PQ) to the quantity of money (M).</p>
<p>Monetarists assume that the velocity of money is unaffected by monetary policy (at least in the long run), and the real value of output is determined in the long run by the productive capacity of the economy. Under these assumptions, the primary driver of the change in the general price level is changes in the quantity of money. With exogenous velocity (that is, velocity being determined externally and not being influenced by monetary policy), the money supply determines the value of nominal output (which equals final expenditure) in the short run. In practice, velocity is not exogenous in the short run, and so the formula does not necessarily imply a stable short-run relationship between the money supply and nominal output. However, in the long run, changes in velocity are assumed to be determined by the evolution of the payments mechanism. If velocity is relatively unaffected by monetary policy, the long-run rate of increase in prices (the inflation rate) is equal to the long-run growth rate of the money supply plus the exogenous long-run rate of velocity growth minus the long run growth rate of real output.</p>
<div id="environmental-costs" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1.1</span> environmental costs</h4>
<p>If the fuel also releases CO2 you also have to consider (if industrial) the EU ETS Allowances (or other,depending on the countries regulation).</p>
<p>Focusing on the variable cost, the CO2 main price driver is the âFuel Switching costâ and coal forwards (coal releases more CO2) and gas forwards, having a direct impact on power prices.</p>
<p>The price dynamic in the emissions market is driven by the power sector.</p>
<p>At the end, it gives a metric of the cost of energy by implementing the projects, so the project with the lowest LCOE should in principle be more advantageous.</p>
<p>For energy generation projects like PV Power plants, or energy savings project (like changing the lighting system), the LCOE is quite similar to the NPV formula and represents the ration between the stream of cash Flows to generate the electricity (or saving electricity) during n years divided by the energy produced (or consumed) during that period.</p>
<p>For example for the PV System project, where its have a 1 y term (for simplicity), the LCOE would be:</p>

<p>Imagine that generates 1000kWh per year, so the costs of each would be 0.11â¬/kWh.</p>
<p>There are some things you should be aware when using this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing and decreasing the lifespan of equipment may change a lot results;</li>
<li>Efficiency of equipment tends to decrease over time and use (meaning that in year 10, you may not be able to generate the same amount of year 1)</li>

<div class="figure">

<p>The global cost must be calculated according to EN15459 as indicated in the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_{g}(\tau) = C_I \sum{_j}[ \sum_{i=1}^{\tau}(C_{a,i(j)} \cdot R_d(i)) - C_{f\tau}(j)]\]</span></p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(Cg(t)\)</span> are the Global costs referring to the starting year Ï=0, <span class="math inline">\(Cl\)</span> are the Initial investment costs, <span class="math inline">\(Ca,i(j)\)</span> are the annual costs year i for energy-related component j (energy costs, operational costs, periodic or replacement costs, maintenance costs), <span class="math inline">\(Rd(i)\)</span> is the discount rate for year i (depending on interest rate) (minus), <span class="math inline">\(Vf,Ï(j)\)</span> is the final value of component j at the end of the calculation period (referred to the starting year Ï=0 ),</p>
<p>The cost-optimum calculations are based on a net present value calculation.</p>
<p>According to Boermans, BettgenhÃ¤user et al., 2011 ( Cost-optimal building performance requirements - Calculation methodology to report on national energy performance requirements on the basis of cost-optimality within the framework of the EPBD, eceee).</p>
<p>When we discuss the cost-optimal levels and the effort to achieve energy savings, only the lower boundary of the cloud is interesting to identify the cost-optimal level. In case of a flat cost-curve, it was suggested to set the requirements in the lower (left) part of the calculated cost-optimal points. This will ensure that the most energy-efficient solution sets are selected. On the other hand, one should also try to avoid going too far on the left side of the curve, as cost-curves often show a tendency of a steep increase in costs when moving to the far left.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.1</span> Risk and uncertainty</h3>
<p>When referring to risk, most relates to the idea if certainty (or the lack of it) and or high or low volatility.</p>
<p>You understand that a deposit is safer than investing in the stock market. For the last you will demand a higher return, or risk premium (usually is equal to risk free rate plus a certain risk on top of that). The later carries higher risk, that could mean you could lose all you invested money (and more if you add some complex financial products).</p>
</div>
<div id="financial-risk-and-operational-risk" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.2</span> Financial risk and operational risk</h3>
<p>It also refer to safety and reliability. In engineering usually it is referred to risk as something you have to mitigate to guarantee a certain level or safety, efficiency or other parameter or, to have safe gauge in the case that something fails. As a control system that may stop some task, send an alarm an so on.</p>
<p>So you have financial risk and operational risk, referring to the implementation and operations of a certain investment.</p>
<p>Understanding risk, means understanding exposure, or what type of events could change you basic underlying assumptions</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical and operational risk;</li>
<li>Regulatory risk;</li>
<li>Market Risk;</li>
<li>Financial Risk;</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example if you run your projections assuming a certain amount of sales and a small change will set to unprofitability, so running several scenarios will help you understand how exposed you are to a change of the demanded volume.</p>
<p>A change in regulation will set more companies working on the same space so setting cannibalism behaviors (as dumping);</p>
<p>First you start by acknowledging the event, then mitigate or (trying to) by different strategies.</p>
<p>You may also choose to pursue option in less probability to being exposed to a certain risk</p>
<p>One of the most common ones relies on technical and operational risk, or how often projects access that the initial parameters still hold.</p>
<p>Basic example is can be described as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Certain manufacturer states stat a certain equipment works for a determined use and need repairs and maintenance every x year of other parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Project managers wants to âmaximize profit and its being working fine until now, nothing seems wrongâ so will save a few Euros and delaying replacement of some fundamental pieces or maintenance and looks great on the financial documents.</p></li>
<li><p>Until a certain day where either have a huge accident or the systems breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Itâs the typical fat tail risk where from previous observations, everything will look âaverageââ¦ in historical data. If you discard that some things will not decrease efficiency, just go from one state to other, because reached a breaking point (or change of state).</p></li>

<p>Considering corporate finance, risk is priced ,usually by the Beta Coefficient of the CAPM model, that coupons the minimum return adjusted to risk.</p>

<div id="due-diligence" class="section level3">

<p>Projects are run by humans and humans (and machines) make errors, so you always should have systems to track errors, not dependent in a single person.</p>
<p>This is why you order audits to third parties which has 2 effects: People will perform differently in they know someone else will verifying;</p>
<p>If more than on person or entity will check the project, you will have lower probability of missing some critical element or information.</p>

<p>NPV function in spreadsheets doesnât really calculate NPV. Instead, despite the word ânet,â the NPV function is really just a present value of uneven cash flow function.</p>
<p>Net present value is defined as the present value of the expected future cash flows less the initial cost of the investment. âNetâ always means that something has been subtracted. In any case, there are two common ways to calculate the real NPV in</p>

<li>Use the NPV function, but leave out the initial outlay. Then, outside of the NPV function, subtract the IO. (Note, the initial outlay is often entered as a negative number, so it will actually be added.)</li>
<li>Use the NPV function and include the initial outlay in the range of cash flows. In this case, the âNPVâ will be in period -1 so we must bring it forward one period in time. So, multiply the result by (1 + i), where i is the per period discount rate.</li>
